## 📦 Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the notebook or scripts:

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `nltk`  
- `joblib`  
- `matplotlib` *(optional, for visualization)*

You can install them with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk joblib matplotlib
````

## 🚀 How to Run

### Using Jupyter Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter and open `sentiment.ipynb`.
2. Execute each cell sequentially:

   * Load data from `sentiment_analysis.csv`
   * Clean and preprocess text
   * Extract features (TF-IDF)
   * Train and evaluate the model
   * Save model as `sentiment_model.pkl`

### Using the Script

Run `se.py` to:

* Load the pre-trained model
* Make predictions on custom input

---

## 📝 Notes

* Ensure all files are in the same directory before executing any script or notebook.
* This project assumes basic familiarity with Python, pandas, and machine learning workflows.
